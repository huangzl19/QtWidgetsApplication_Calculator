# QtWidgetsApplication_Calculator

I feel puzzled. The main problems include:
* The code of Qt projects constructed by VS2019 seems to be quite different from which was constructed by Qt Creator.
* The text encoding is unmatched when a Qt project is downloaded from github.
* When push to GitHub, many related files can't be uploaded automatically by the github extension inside VS2019 and need to be uploaded by hand. However, even by doing this, I still cannot get a project which works.
